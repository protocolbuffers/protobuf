//  Based on original Protocol Buffers design by
//  Sanjay Ghemawat, Jeff Dean, and others.
//
// This file contains the ZeroCopyInputStream and ZeroCopyOutputStream
// interfaces, which represent abstract I/O streams to and from which
// protocol buffers can be read and written.  For a few simple
// implementations of these interfaces, see zero_copy_stream_impl.h.
//
// These interfaces are different from classic I/O streams in that they
// try to minimize the amount of data copying that needs to be done.
// To accomplish this, responsibility for allocating buffers is moved to
// the stream object, rather than being the responsibility of the caller.
// So, the stream can return a buffer which actually points directly into
// the final data structure where the bytes are to be stored, and the caller
// can interact directly with that buffer, eliminating an intermediate copy
// operation.
//
// As an example, consider the common case in which you are reading bytes
// from an array that is already in memory (or perhaps an mmap()ed file).
// With classic I/O streams, you would do something like:
//   char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
//   input->Read(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);
//   DoSomething(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);
// Then, the stream basically just calls memcpy() to copy the data from
// the array into your buffer.  With a ZeroCopyInputStream, you would do
// this instead:
//   const void* buffer;
//   int size;
//   input->Next(&buffer, &size);
//   DoSomething(buffer, size);
// Here, no copy is performed.  The input stream returns a pointer directly
// into the backing array, and the caller ends up reading directly from it.
//
// If you want to be able to read the old-fashion way, you can create
// a CodedInputStream or CodedOutputStream wrapping these objects and use
// their ReadRaw()/WriteRaw() methods.  These will, of course, add a copy
// step, but Coded*Stream will handle buffering so at least it will be
// reasonably efficient.
//
// ZeroCopyInputStream example:
//   // Read in a file and print its contents to stdout.
//   int fd = open("myfile", O_RDONLY);
//   ZeroCopyInputStream* input = new FileInputStream(fd);
//
//   const void* buffer;
//   int size;
//   while (input->Next(&buffer, &size)) {
//     cout.write(buffer, size);
//   }
//
//   delete input;
//   close(fd);
//
// ZeroCopyOutputStream example:
//   // Copy the contents of "infile" to "outfile", using plain read() for
//   // "infile" but a ZeroCopyOutputStream for "outfile".
//   int infd = open("infile", O_RDONLY);
//   int outfd = open("outfile", O_WRONLY);
//   ZeroCopyOutputStream* output = new FileOutputStream(outfd);
//
//   void* buffer;
//   int size;
//   while (output->Next(&buffer, &size)) {
//     int bytes = read(infd, buffer, size);
//     if (bytes < size) {
//       // Reached EOF.
//       output->BackUp(size - bytes);
//       break;
//     }
//   }
//
//   delete output;
//   close(infd);
//   close(outfd);
