/* Extension registry: a dynamic data structure that stores a map of:
 *   (upb_MiniTable, number) -> extension info
 *
 * upb_decode() uses upb_ExtensionRegistry to look up extensions while parsing
 * binary format.
 *
 * upb_ExtensionRegistry is part of the mini-table (msglayout) family of
 * objects. Like all mini-table objects, it is suitable for reflection-less
 * builds that do not want to expose names into the binary.
 *
 * Unlike most mini-table types, upb_ExtensionRegistry requires dynamic memory
 * allocation and dynamic initialization:
 * * If reflection is being used, then upb_DefPool will construct an appropriate
 *   upb_ExtensionRegistry automatically.
 * * For a mini-table only build, the user must manually construct the
 *   upb_ExtensionRegistry and populate it with all of the extensions the user
 * cares about.
 * * A third alternative is to manually unpack relevant extensions after the
 *   main parse is complete, similar to how Any works. This is perhaps the
 *   nicest solution from the perspective of reducing dependencies, avoiding
 *   dynamic memory allocation, and avoiding the need to parse uninteresting
 *   extensions.  The downsides are:
 *     (1) parse errors are not caught during the main parse
 *     (2) the CPU hit of parsing comes during access, which could cause an
 *         undesirable stutter in application performance.
 *
 * Users cannot directly get or put into this map. Users can only add the
 * extensions from a generated module and pass the extension registry to the
 * binary decoder.
 *
 * A upb_DefPool provides a upb_ExtensionRegistry, so any users who use
 * reflection do not need to populate a upb_ExtensionRegistry directly.
