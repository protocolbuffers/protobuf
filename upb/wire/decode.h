   * IMPORTANT CAVEATS:
   *
   * 1. This can throw a false positive failure if an incomplete message is seen
   *    on the wire but is later completed when the sub-message occurs again.
   *    For this reason, a second pass is required to verify a failure, to be
   *    truly robust.
   *
   * 2. This can return a false success if you are decoding into a message that
   *    already has some sub-message fields present.  If the sub-message does
   *    not occur in the binary payload, we will never visit it and discover the
   *    incomplete sub-message.  For this reason, this check is only useful for
   *    implemting ParseFromString() semantics.  For MergeFromString(), a
   *    post-parse validation step will always be necessary. */

  /* EXPERIMENTAL:

   * If set, the parser will allow parsing of sub-message fields that were not
   * previously linked using upb_MiniTable_SetSubMessage().  The data will be
   * parsed into an internal "empty" message type that cannot be accessed
   * directly, but can be later promoted into the true message type if the
   * sub-message fields are linked at a later time.
   *
   * Users should set this option if they intend to perform dynamic tree shaking
   * and promoting using the interfaces in message/promote.h.  If this option is
   * enabled, it is important that the resulting messages are only accessed by
   * code that is aware of promotion rules:
   *
   * 1. Message pointers in upb_Message, upb_Array, and upb_Map are represented
   *    by a tagged pointer upb_TaggedMessagePointer.  The tag indicates whether
   *    the message uses the internal "empty" type.
   *
   * 2. Any code *reading* these message pointers must test whether the "empty"
   *    tag bit is set, using the interfaces in mini_table/types.h.  However
   *    writing of message pointers should always use plain upb_Message*, since
   *    users are not allowed to create "empty" messages.
   *
   * 3. It is always safe to test whether a field is present or test the array
   *    length; these interfaces will reflect that empty messages are present,
   *    even though their data cannot be accessed without promoting first.
   *
   * 4. If a message pointer is indeed tagged as empty, the message may not be
   *    accessed directly, only promoted through the interfaces in
   *    message/promote.h.
   *
   * 5. Tagged/empty messages may never be created by the user.  They may only
   *    be created by the parser or the message-copying logic in message/copy.h.
