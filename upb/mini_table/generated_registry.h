/* Generated registry: a global singleton that gathers all extensions linked
 * into the binary.
 *
 * This singleton is thread-safe and lock-free, implemented using atomics.  The
 * registry is lazily initialized the first time it is loaded.  When all
 * references are released, the registry will be destroyed.  New loads
 * afterwards will simply reload the same registry as needed.
 *
 * The extension minitables are registered in gencode using linker arrays.  Each
 * .proto file produces a weak, hidden, constructor function that adds all
 * visible extensions from the array into the registry.  In each binary, only
 * one copy of the constructor will actually be preserved by the linker, and
 * that copy will add all of the extensions for the entire binary.  All of these
 * are added to a global linked list of minitables pre-main, which are then used
 * to construct this singleton as needed.
