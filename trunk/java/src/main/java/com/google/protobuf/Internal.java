   * The protocol compiler does not actually contain a UTF-8 decoder -- it
   * just pushes UTF-8-encoded text around without touching it.  The one place
   * where this presents a problem is when generating Java string literals.
   * Unicode characters in the string literal would normally need to be encoded
   * using a Unicode escape sequence, which would require decoding them.
   * To get around this, protoc instead embeds the UTF-8 bytes into the
   * generated code and leaves it to the runtime library to decode them.
   * <p>
   * It gets worse, though.  If protoc just generated a byte array, like:
   *   new byte[] {0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78}
   * Java actually generates *code* which allocates an array and then fills
   * in each value.  This is much less efficient than just embedding the bytes
   * directly into the bytecode.  To get around this, we need another
   * work-around.  String literals are embedded directly, so protoc actually
   * generates a string literal corresponding to the bytes.  The easiest way
   * to do this is to use the ISO-8859-1 character set, which corresponds to
   * the first 256 characters of the Unicode range.  Protoc can then use
   * good old CEscape to generate the string.
   * <p>
   * So we have a string literal which represents a set of bytes which
   * represents another string.  This function -- stringDefaultValue --
   * converts from the generated string to the string we actually want.  The
   * generated code calls this automatically.
