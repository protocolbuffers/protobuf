The build time dependency crate for generating code for the official Google Rust
Protobuf implementation.

The code generated by this is expected to be used in conjunction with the
official [Protobuf crate](http://crates.io/crates/protobuf).

This is currently a beta release: the API is subject to change,
and there may be some rough edges, including missing documentation and features.

# How to get a compatible version of protoc

Usage of this crate currently requires protoc to be built from
source, as it relies on changes that have not been included in the newest protoc
release yet.

A future stable release will be compatible with the officially released protoc
binaries.

You can build a compatible protoc from source as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git
cd protobuf
git checkout rust-prerelease-{VERSION}
cmake . -Dprotobuf_FORCE_FETCH_DEPENDENCIES=ON
cmake --build . --parallel 12"
```
