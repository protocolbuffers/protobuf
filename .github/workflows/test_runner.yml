# This file implements the protection strategy laid out in
# go/protobuf-gha-protected-resources.  Pull requests from branches within this
# repository are considered safe and will immediately start running tests on
# every commit.  Pull requests from forked repositories are unsafe, and leave
# us vulnerable to PWN requests and stolen resources.  In these cases, we
# require a special "safe for tests" tag to be added to the pull request before
# we start testing.  This will be immediately removed, so that further commits
# require their own stamp to test.
