        #    this case we want to make sure there are no stale files.
        # 2) Release branches don't work with automated commits (see b/287117570).  Until this is
        #    fixed, we want to run the tests to force manual regeneration when necessary.

        # In branches where automatic updates work as post-submits, we don't want to run staleness
        # tests along with user changes.  Any stale files will be automatically fixed in a follow-up
        # commit.
