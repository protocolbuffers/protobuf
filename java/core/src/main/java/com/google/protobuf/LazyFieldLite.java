/**
 * LazyFieldLite encapsulates the logic of lazily parsing message fields. It stores the message in a
 * ByteString initially and then parses it on-demand.
 *
 * <p>LazyFieldLite is thread-compatible: concurrent reads are safe once the proto that this
 * LazyFieldLite is a part of is no longer being mutated by its Builder. However, explicit
 * synchronization is needed under read/write situations.
 *
 * <p>When a LazyFieldLite is used in the context of a MessageLite object, its behavior is
 * considered to be immutable and none of the setter methods in its API are expected to be invoked.
 * All of the getters are expected to be thread-safe. When used in the context of a
 * MessageLite.Builder, setters can be invoked, but there is no guarantee of thread safety.
 *
 * <p>TODO: Consider splitting this class's functionality and put the mutable methods
 * into a separate builder class to allow us to give stronger compile-time guarantees.
 *
 * <p>This class is internal implementation detail of the protobuf library, so you don't need to use
 * it directly.

  /*
   * The value associated with the LazyFieldLite object is stored in one or more of the following
   * three fields (delayedBytes, value, memoizedBytes). They should together be interpreted as
   * follows.
   *
   * 1) delayedBytes can be non-null, while value and memoizedBytes is null. The object will be in
   * this state while the value for the object has not yet been parsed.
   *
   * 2) Both delayedBytes and value are non-null. The object transitions to this state as soon as
   * some caller needs to access the value (by invoking getValue()).
   *
   * 3) memoizedBytes is merely an optimization for calls to LazyFieldLite.toByteString() to avoid
   * recomputing the ByteString representation on each call. Instead, when the value is parsed from
   * delayedBytes, we will also assign the contents of delayedBytes to memoizedBytes (since that is
   * the ByteString representation of value).
   *
   * 4) Finally, if the LazyFieldLite was created directly with a parsed MessageLite value, then
   * delayedBytes will be null, and memoizedBytes will be initialized only upon the first call to
   * LazyFieldLite.toByteString().
   *
   * <p>Given the above conditions, any caller that needs a serialized representation of this object
   * must first check if the memoizedBytes or delayedBytes ByteString is non-null and use it
   * directly; if both of those are null, it can look at the parsed value field. Similarly, any
   * caller that needs a parsed value must first check if the value field is already non-null, if
   * not it must parse the value from delayedBytes.
