   * (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).
   * In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
   * expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
   * scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
   * server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
   * * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
   * * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
   *   value in binary format, or produce an error.
   * * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
   *   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
   *   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
   *   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
   *   breaking changes.)
   * Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
   * protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
   * type.googleapis.com.
   * Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
   * used with implementation specific semantics.
